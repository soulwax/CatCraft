# CatCraft
### (Minecraft Version 1.19.4)

## HUGE RECOMMENDATION:
## DELETE THE /plugins/CatCraft FOLDER BEFORE UPDATING TO THIS VERSION! I USE YAML LOG FILES NOW AND THE OLD LOG FILES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW VERSION!

A bukkit plugin for Minecraft with various functionalities for personal use.

Feature List:
- Non-invasive player logger via login timestamp
- Relaying opened chests (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Relaying entities dealing damage to other entities to the server shell (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Defends cats by deflecting damage inflicted to cats, ocelots and so on. Instantly kills an entity that killed a cat, ocelot etc (Low event priority to keep it lightweight)
- Formats the chat to differentiate between members, mods and admins
- Japanese emoji replacement (Can be turned off - see config.yml)


### Command List:

**/cc** or **/catcraft** followed by:
- inv [player] -> Peek into player's inventory
- ender [player] -> Peek into a player's ender chest
- disarm [player] -> Take his armor (and optionally main-hand) into your own inventory
- msgall [message] -> Sends an anonymous instant message to all logged in players
- reload -> reloads the plugin
- help -> List possible commands
- rules -> List rules specified in the config.yml file
- credits -> List credits, including the link to this github repo

**Private whisper function:**
- /ccw [player] [message] -> Sends a non-anonymous private message to a player.

**Discord Ignore Global Chat Message function:**
- /anon [message]

### Permission nodes:

- catcraft.admin -> for /cc or /catcraft commands (WARNING: recommended to give it only to the highest ranked players / OPs)
- catcraft.whisper -> for /ccw (recommended to allow all players to use it)
- chat.format.* (use to your hearts content if you want to differentiate the power levels via chat)
- - chat.format.member (default)
- - chat.format.moderator
- - chat.format.admin (op)


## Build Instructions
### Eclipse:
1. Open Eclipse
2. Import project as "Existing maven project"
3. Build as Maven Install

### IntelliJ Idea with Gradle:
1. Open project in IntelliJ Idea
2. Click the "Import Project" button
3. Select the build.gradle file
4. Click "OK"
5. Build as Gradle Jar

### Visual Studio Code:
1. You may need additional plugins such as:
   - "Maven for Java"
   - "Extension Pack for Java"
2. You may need to install maven and adjust the path varibale to point to the executable.
3. Once everything is set up, open a terminal within VS Code and type:
   ```mvn jar:jar install:install```
4. Your .jar file should be contained in the /target folder now. Enjoy!

**Final step:** Put the generated .jar in the /plugins folder of your MC server.
Important last recommendation for 1.17.1 and upwards: Delete the /plugins/CatCraft folder due to drastic changes made to how the logger works.

Done!
