A bukkit plugin for Minecraft with various functionalities for personal use. 

Feature List:

- Relaying opened chests (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Relaying entities dealing damage to other entities to the server shell (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Defends cats by deflecting damage inflicted to cats, ocelots and so on. Instantly kills an entity that killed a cat, ocelot etc (Low event priority to keep it lightweight)

## Build Instructions
### Eclipse:
1. Open Eclipse
2. Import project as "Existing maven project"
3. Build as Maven Install

### IntelliJ Idea:
1. Open project root folder as -> Maven, not Eclipse! - click OK 
2. Add Configuration -> Add New (+) -> choose: "Maven" from the list
3. Type in the "Command Line" option under "Parameters" -> "install" (without the "")
4. Click the Play Button (or Shift+F10) -> the generated snapshot .jar file will be inside the /project_root/target folder

### Visual Studio Code:
You may need additional plugins such as:
- "Maven for Java"
- "Extension Pack for Java"
You may need to install maven and adjust the path varibale to point to the executable.
Once everything is set up, open a terminal within VS Code and type: 
```mvn jar:jar install:install```

Your .jar file should should be contained in the /target folder now. Enjoy!

**Final step:** Put the generated .jar in the /plugins folder of your MC server.
Important last recommendation for 1.17.1 and upwards: Delete the /plugins/CatCraft folder due to drastic changes made to how the logger works.

Done!
