# CatCraft

## (Minecraft Version 1.20.1)

### A bukkit plugin for Minecraft with various functionalities for personal use

## HUGE RECOMMENDATION

## DELETE THE /plugins/CatCraft FOLDER BEFORE UPDATING TO THIS VERSION! I USE YAML LOG FILES NOW AND THE OLD LOG FILES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW VERSION

### But, to equivocate, it won't break anything either. It's just gonna be a mess. Plus, the emoji replacement relies on the config.yml to be set to true at the respective line. No updated config file may disable the feature now

Feature List:

- Non-invasive player logger via login timestamp
- Relaying opened chests (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Relaying entities dealing damage to other entities to the server shell (Can be turned off - see config.yml)
- Defends cats by deflecting damage inflicted to cats, ocelots and so on. Instantly kills an entity that killed a cat, ocelot etc (Low event priority to keep it lightweight)
- Formats the chat to differentiate between members, mods and admins
- Japanese emoji replacement (Can be turned off - see config.yml)

## Command List

**/cc** or **/catcraft** followed by:

- inv [player] -> Peek into player's inventory
- ender [player] -> Peek into a player's ender chest
- disarm [player] -> Take his armor (and optionally main-hand) into your own inventory
- msgall [message] -> Sends an anonymous instant message to all logged in players
- reload -> reloads the plugin
- help -> List possible commands
- rules -> List rules specified in the config.yml file
- credits -> List credits, including the link to this github repo

**Private whisper function:**

- /ccw [player] [message] -> Sends a non-anonymous private message to a player.

**Discord Ignore Global Chat Message function:**

- /anon [message]

## Permission nodes

- catcraft.admin -> for /cc or /catcraft commands (WARNING: recommended to give it only to the highest ranked players / OPs)
- catcraft.whisper -> for /ccw (recommended to allow all players to use it)
- chat.format.* (use to your hearts content if you want to differentiate the power levels via chat)
  - chat.format.member (default)
  - chat.format.moderator
  - chat.format.admin (op)

## Build Instructions

You need to have JDK 17 installed. (<https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot>)
All there is to it:

```bash
.\gradlew jar
```

On Linux / Mac:

```bash
./gradlew jar
```

The build output is: `./build/libs` as it is the default for Gradle builds.

### You can use different IDEs to your hearts content. I use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or VS Code, it doesn't matter

**Final step:** Put the generated .jar in the /plugins folder of your MC server.
Important last recommendation for 1.17.1 and upwards: Delete the /plugins/CatCraft folder due to drastic changes made to how the logger works.

Done!
